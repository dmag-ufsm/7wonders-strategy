The objective of this is to compare the data with our Data Mining results and to
attribute numerical values (points) to the most important cards.

## AGE I (P. 3)

- Focus on Military:
    - **Try to get 2 Red cards**.
- Focus on Brown Resources.
    - **Clay/Ore** (to build free military cards).
- **Avoid Gray & Blue cards**.
- If you start with Rhodes/Babylon,
    - Pick Stone/Wood
- You don't need to win battles in
  Age I, but you NEED to win battles
  in Age II.
- Try to get Marketplace so you can buy
  cheap Gray cards!
  - You need Glass and Cloth for Age III.
- Trading Posts are a nice addition.
- Try to have the **monopoly of one brown**:
    - Suggestion: Wood
        - This way, your neighbors need to buy
          it from you and you get money.
- Basically, you need:
    - **2 Military cards (Reds)**; 
    - **Marketplace or 1 Gray (Glass or Cloth)**;
    - **2 Brown resources**.
- The last action can be used to:
    - Play another Yellow card;
    - Discard for 3 gold;
    - Play a Blue/Brown;
    - Construct a Wonder step;
    - DON'T PLAY A THIRD RED!
- Anti-play:
    - Another divine rule:
        - PREVENT A THIRD SCIENCE SET (ENEMIES).
        - To help this, try to **"burn" the tablet card**.
    - The most important anti-play is:
        - Don't allow another player to complete
          the first set of Science cards!
    
## AGE II (P. 7)

- It's nice to play as a first card a Red one, even if you have to pay.
    - If you now have 4 Shields, you can just stash one of the other 
      Red cards.
- Pay attention to a card that produce 2 Stone
  so you can build Wall (which gives 2 Shields). 
- Once you assure that you're the military leader,
  focus on getting access to the resources you lack
  and building 1 or 2 Blue cards.
- Rushing the 3rd Wonder stage in Age II is generally
  a bad idea. You'll probably need to stash something in it at
  Age III.
- **You MUST be the military leader by the end of Age II!**

## AGE III (P. 10)
Here Pistolero's goes a bit more in-depth by showing actual game examples. As
it's a lot to digest and summarize, I suggest reading them directly from the
guide. I'll just summarize the general strategy below:
- Always playing the card that grants (or will grant, in case of Guilds) 
  the most points is a fallible strategy -- don't think about "absolute"
  values, but "relative" values.
- What matters is to identify a player that _has a chance_ to win and then play
  against that player. So you just need to make mental math to choose what card
  is the most advantageous to you and less benefical to your enemies.
- No need for more Red cards... unless you absolutely need them.
- When you can choose to play the same amount of money to both your neighbors,
  choose the neighbor that will finish last.
    - For each (+3) points you get over the last player, you should play to this
      player even if it costs you one more gold!
- Since the absolute value of cards played diminishes as Age III goes by, the
  effectiveness of playing a Red card in Age III is greater the LATER you play
  it; when you play against Science, this last remark is not so true.
-  **The Victory Points of the Age III battles are attributed to the Red cards
   of Age II!**
- In case you were leading at the end of Age II and you must take a Red card
  (in case you are competing with other military players and is in danger of
  losing both battles),
  make sure it's the only one needed to win both battles; then you need to
  stash the next Red cards in due time!
- **In case you're not the military leader in Age III, the idea is generally to
  play a Red card as late as possible** -- to use this strategy you need at least
  one free Wonder step to stash another Red card and prevent your opponent from
  going back in front of you.
- Interesting observation: lower average score between players tipically means
  that the players play the game better; that is, they're able to think
  relatively.

## HOW TO PLAY THE WONDERS (P. 25)
#### TODO (it's a long section but it has lots of images)
* What's the purpose of building wonder stages?
    * **Deny cards to opponents.**
    * The rewards you get is merely just a side effect of stashing a card.
    * It's totally ok to build the first two stages in Age II, and even more so
      when the mad scientist completed the first set in Age I; in that case,
      you MUST remove 2 Green cards in Age II.
* Which side should you choose?
    * Hali, Alex and Ephesos -> always B side.
* **Pistolero's Personal Wonder Ranking for 3-player games (P. 30):**
    * 1. HALIKARNASSOS (B)
    * 2. ALEXANDRIA (B), RHODOS (B)
    * 3. BABYLOS (B), OLYMPIA (B), EPHESOS (B)
    * 4. GIZAH (B)

#### EPHESOS (P. 33)
