Strategy Guide_](https://en.boardgamearena.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=192&t=14557).

The objective of this is to compare the data with our Data Mining results and to
attribute numerical values (points) to the most important cards.

## AGE I (P. 3)

- Focus on Military:
    - **Try to get 2 Red cards**.
- Focus on Brown Resources.
    - **Clay/Ore** (to build free military cards).
- **Avoid Gray & Blue cards**.
- If you start with Rhodes/Babylon,
    - Pick Stone/Wood
- You don't need to win battles in
  Age I, but you NEED to win battles
  in Age II.
- Try to get Marketplace so you can buy
  cheap Gray cards!
  - You need Glass and Cloth for Age III.
- Trading Posts are a nice addition.
- Try to have the **monopoly of one brown**:
    - Suggestion: Wood
        - This way, your neighbors need to buy
          it from you and you get money.
- Basically, you need:
    - **2 Military cards (Reds)**; 
    - **Marketplace or 1 Gray (Glass or Cloth)**;
    - **2 Brown resources**.
- The last action can be used to:
    - Play another Yellow card;
    - Discard for 3 gold;
    - Play a Blue/Brown;
    - Construct a Wonder step;
    - DON'T PLAY A THIRD RED!
- Anti-play:
    - Another divine rule:
        - PREVENT A THIRD SCIENCE SET (ENEMIES).
        - To help this, try to **"burn" the tablet card**.
    - The most important anti-play is:
        - Don't allow another player to complete
          the first set of Science cards!
    
## AGE II (P. 7)

- It's nice to play as a first card a Red one, even if you have to pay.
    - If you now have 4 Shields, you can just stash one of the other 
      Red cards.
- Pay attention to a card that produce 2 Stone
  so you can build Wall (which gives 2 Shields). 
- Once you assure that you're the military leader,
  focus on getting access to the resources you lack
  and building 1 or 2 Blue cards.
- Rushing the 3rd Wonder stage in Age II is generally
  a bad idea. You'll probably need to stash something in it at
  Age III.
- **You MUST be the military leader by the end of Age II!**

## AGE III (P. 10)
Here Pistolero's goes a bit more in-depth by showing actual game examples. As
it's a lot to digest and summarize, I suggest reading them directly from the
guide. I'll just summarize the general strategy below:
- Always playing the card that grants (or will grant, in case of Guilds) 
  the most points is a fallible strategy -- don't think about "absolute"
  values, but "relative" values.
- What matters is to identify a player that _has a chance_ to win and then play
  against that player. So you just need to make mental math to choose what card
  is the most advantageous to you and less benefical to your enemies.
- No need for more Red cards... unless you absolutely need them.
- When you can choose to play the same amount of money to both your neighbors,
  choose the neighbor that will finish last.
    - For each (+3) points you get over the last player, you should play to this
      player even if it costs you one more gold!
- Since the absolute value of cards played diminishes as Age III goes by, the
  effectiveness of playing a Red card in Age III is greater the LATER you play
  it; when you play against Science, this last remark is not so true.
-  **The Victory Points of the Age III battles are attributed to the Red cards
   of Age II!**
- In case you were leading at the end of Age II and you must take a Red card
  (in case you are competing with other military players and is in danger of
  losing both battles),
  make sure it's the only one needed to win both battles; then you need to
  stash the next Red cards in due time!
- **In case you're not the military leader in Age III, the idea is generally to
  play a Red card as late as possible** -- to use this strategy you need at least
  one free Wonder step to stash another Red card and prevent your opponent from
  going back in front of you.
- Interesting observation: lower average score between players tipically means
  that the players play the game better; that is, they're able to think
  relatively.

## HOW TO PLAY THE WONDERS (P. 25)
#### TODO (it's a long section but it has lots of images)
* What's the purpose of building wonder stages?
    * **Deny cards to opponents.**
    * The rewards you get is merely just a side effect of stashing a card.
    * It's totally ok to build the first two stages in Age II, and even more so
      when the mad scientist completed the first set in Age I; in that case,
      you MUST remove 2 Green cards in Age II.
* Which side should you choose?
    * Hali, Alex and Ephesos -> always B side.
* **Pistolero's Personal Wonder Ranking for 3-player games (P. 30):**
    * 1. HALIKARNASSOS (B)
    * 2. ALEXANDRIA (B), RHODOS (B)
    * 3. BABYLOS (B), OLYMPIA (B), EPHESOS (B)
    * 4. GIZAH (B)

#### EPHESOS (P. 33)
->Regular supply of money and low resources needed to unlock the stages.
* If you go military, you probably won’t have time to fetch any other science card than the free Tablet.
* If no one builds science
    * Take the blue cards first and finish the ages with the tablets (after you took the red cards).
* Else If have a mad scientist around
    * Build the Tablets before the blue cards.
* **Trading Post** card it’s good because you have the regular supply of money.
* If you have the Trading Post card take the **Forum** because it's free.
* With two scientific symbols you can leverage the **scientific guild** (that allow you to get 1 scientific symbol).
* In age 2
    * The **2 Ore** card links very well with: Compass | Theater | Hero guild.
    * The **2 Clay** gives you: Gear | Forum for free.
    * You need to dominate the military in age 2, not age 1.
* Remember that the monopoly of one resource can be good, Pistoleiro give an example that you are in the 1 age, and you have to choose between Baths and wood, you already have a |stone / wood| so if you pick the wood you will have the monopoly of wood and this is the best option in this case, it also goes well with the Age 2 red card that uses 2 wood (in this strategy is good evoid that your neighbors build the Trading Post).

#### ALEXANDRIA (P. 50)
->Is a strong wonder since it allows you to have access to all resources very easily. (you can choose your strategy)
* Age 1
	* Is important to play **1 Clay** card and unlock the first stage
* Age 2
	* You need build the **second stage** in this age to stach red or green cards
	* Weakness - you can be tempted to rush your 3rd step from Age 2, because you’re behind in points, only do it if your last hand is a resource that you don’t need, as stashing in Age 3 is really important to control science or military.
* Science strategy
    * He discard the |Stone / Wood| card to prevent that his neighbors use it, pick a Textile to help build science and stash the Stone that Gizah needed to build the second stage, so it’s very important to follow your neighbors steps
    * He use the MarketPlace to buy cheaper from his neighbors
* Military strategy
	* He uses both Trading Post
* Sometimes it’s tempting to stash a red card to prevent the neighbor from getting an advantage, but you have to think what is the best play, for example Pistoleiro chooses to pick a Stone to help build the Wall and the 3rd stage than stash the red card

#### BABYLON (P. 61) - more difficult
->To have a chance to win, you must play science, you have to balance the science and military based on your neighbors hand
* General rule = **“no rush”**
* Science
	* You have to play some science to maximize the potential of the **3rd step** (that gives to you a free science)
* Military
	* It’s more important to build **brown cards** as they allow you to build the military cards and the Age 3
* Age 2
	* You don’t need to dominate in age 1, but you will need in age 2
	* Begin the age 2 without money is not good
*  **Paper** is more important than Glass
* 2 Stone can be a good card as it allows to try to pick some cards like: Wall | Tablet | Compass
* Monopoly of the wood can be a good play as well
* It’s important to keep one stage available to stash the 3rd red card at the last turn

#### RHODES (P. 85)
-> Wonder that it's good for military strategy
* Military
	* You have to **win the 2nd**  battle
	* You have to balance the red cards, it’s not good not choose red cards wisely, because if you have one card that fits better in your strategy you can earn more points, the situation that pistoleiro shows is: In age 3 Rhodes are dominating military with 1 shield of difference, he choose pick a +3 shield, but it’s a bad move because it was better if he picks de +7 Pantheon
	* The lesson is that it’s not because you’re Rhodes that you need to absolutely get those
shields during Age 1. Focus on enabling access to resources so that your Age 2 is more efficient
	* The lesson now is how playing one science card instead of going full military (typically when pitted against Hali or Babylon), helps you weaken the science player throughout the game
	* It’s possible to mix military and scientific strategy and this can be very good
* Age 1
	* If Gizah is present, take the **1x Stone** and try to point a **Trading Post** in Gizah’s direction
	* Instead of the 2nd red card, you manage to pick something useful (Don’t exchange the red card for a 2-point card)
	* don’t put yourself in danger to get a red card
	* When you and the left player have one shield, and you receive the third shield card, watch if the right player can build it easily. It can be great to let him have it and hope that all of you each take one red card in Age 2
* Age 2
	* If Gizah isn’t present, don’t pick the 1x Stone, and wait for Age 2 to build the 2x Stone
	* Science might be a way out of the game if Age 2 turns bad
	* keep a good amount of money for all the buys needed
* Age 3
	* Be aware when one red card in Age 3 from both opponents could shift you from leader to loser
	* Taking 2 red cards Age 3 can be effective if done correctly and with reasoning
* **Caravansery** is a good card, but never count on receiving it
* The **Haven** is a very strong card when you need to leverage a lot of brown cards and need a refill on money.
* The **Hero Guild** is worth more, but it’s important to keep at least 2 gold to perform the first stage if nothing is playable

#### GIZAH (P. 108)
->Pistoleiro hate this wonder
* Focus your second Age on the red cards and win the game (in the most of the time is better just build the first and the second stage, and maybe the third)
* Gizah reaches its full potential when you play its last three steps during Age 3 and stash valuable cards for your opponents
* If you had the time to unlock your stages early, why didn’t you pick the red and blue cards?
* Apart from Paper , you can freely ignore the gray resources and get a lot of brown resources
* Just be sure you can pay for Textile to play the Haven
* Age 3
	* We want to keep the stages free for Age 3
* **Trading Post** can be a good play and allows forum for free

#### OLYMPIA (P. 122)
->Pistoleiro prefers A side, but the other side it’s good too
* **Textile** it’s a good card since unlock your 3rd stage (if you are playing B side)
* Military
	* You have be careful for not start the age 2 without money because you make your 1st stage
* **Trading Post** continues a good card for military because you need a lot of brown resources for military strategy
* Some strategies utilize science strategy with military, if you pick textile you can get the compass and get a free chain to the red card Stables
* Science comes after the 2nd war
* The Townhall, Senate and Gardens, are very good cards to pick when you didn’t invest on grey resources earlier in the game
* Age 1
	*Blue card are an trap (you should consider sell or use for build the wonder)

#### HALIKARNASSOS  (P. 142) 
*...
